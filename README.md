# AimAze Tech Solutions Free Static Website

This folder is ready for free static hosting such as Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or Vercel.

## Files

- `index.html` - public website entry point
- `admin/` - Decap CMS editor files for `/admin/`
- `static-site.js` - renders the website from `content.json`
- `content.json` - editable website content
- `styles.css` - responsive design and AimAze colors
- `script.js` - navigation and contact form behavior
- `assets/` - images and logo
- `netlify.toml` - tells Netlify to publish this folder directly

## Editing

Edit `content.json` to change text, services, FAQ, contact email, links, and images. Then redeploy/upload the folder again.

## Free CMS Option

This project includes Decap CMS so you can edit content at:

`https://aimazetechsolutions.com/admin/`

To activate it:

1. Create a GitHub repository for this folder.
2. Confirm `admin/config.yml` uses your real GitHub repo path: `aimazetechsolutions-ship-it/aimazetechsolutions`.
3. Connect the GitHub repo to Netlify instead of using manual drag-and-drop deploys.
4. Use Decap CMS with your GitHub login. Your GitHub account must have write access to the repo.

## Netlify

Upload this whole folder or the zip file to Netlify. After deployment, add the custom domain `aimazetechsolutions.com` in Netlify, then update DNS in Hostinger as Netlify instructs.
